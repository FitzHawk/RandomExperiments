# RandomExperiments

This is just a repository used to document my testing and learning about various
technologies. Each experiment will be contained within its own subfolder and
they will all be relatively small and simplistic.

Thank you for taking a look, if you have any questions or reccomendations for how
to improve feel free to open an issue!
